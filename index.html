      Before food was tasted, it was smelled.<br>
      Before aroma filled kitchens, it crossed oceans.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sugandha exists to preserve the original aroma of spices —
      not to sell, not to persuade, but to remember.

      <summary>1. The Chilli Plant</summary>
      <p>
        Chilli is a fruit that grows on a plant. It begins green and turns red
        when mature. Everything that follows depends on this moment.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>2. Chilli Varieties</summary>
      <p>
        Some chillies are grown for heat. Some for colour.
        No single chilli does everything honestly.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>3. Whole Dried Chilli</summary>
      <p>
        This is the most transparent form of chilli.
        If truth is lost here, it cannot be recovered later.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>4. Chilli Powder</summary>
      <p>
        Powder brings convenience, but hides identity.
        Trust becomes necessary once visibility is lost.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>5. Chilli Flakes</summary>
      <p>
        Flakes preserve visibility.
        What you see is what you cook with.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>6. Heat</summary>
      <p>
        Heat is sensation, not flavour.
        Controlled heat invites eating; aggressive heat ends it.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>7. Colour</summary>
      <p>
        Colour creates expectation.
        Stability matters more than intensity.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>8. Oleoresins</summary>
      <p>
        Liquid chilli exists to provide control in large-scale food,
        not to replace the plant.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>9. Lab Truth</summary>
      <p>
        Tests exist to reduce arguments,
        not to replace judgement.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>10. Export Reality</summary>
      <p>
        Export rewards clarity and punishes surprises.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>11. Make Your Own Chilli Powder</summary>
      <p>
        The closest path to truth is grinding small quantities
        from whole chillies.
