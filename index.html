      Before food was tasted, it was smelled.<br>
      Before aroma filled kitchens, it crossed oceans.

    <p>
      Sugandha exists to preserve the original aroma of spices —
      not to sell, not to persuade, but to remember.

      <summary>. The Chilli Plant</summary>
      <p>
        Chilli is a fruit that grows on a plant.
        It begins green and turns red when mature.
        Everything that follows depends on this moment.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>. Chilli Varieties</summary>
      <p>
        Some chillies are grown for heat.
        Some for colour.
        No single chilli does everything honestly.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>. Whole Dried Chilli</summary>
      <p>
        This is the most transparent form of chilli.
        If truth is lost here, it is lost everywhere.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>. Chilli Powder</summary>
      <p>
        Powder brings convenience, but hides identity.
        Trust becomes necessary once visibility is lost.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>. Chilli Flakes</summary>
      <p>
        Flakes preserve visibility.
        What you see is what you cook with.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>. Heat</summary>
      <p>
        Heat is sensation, not flavour.
        Controlled heat invites eating;
        aggressive heat ends it.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>. Colour</summary>
      <p>
        Colour creates expectation.
        Stability matters more than intensity.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>. Oleoresins</summary>
      <p>
        Liquid chilli exists to provide control in large-scale food,
        not to replace the plant.
      </p>
    </details>

    

    <details>
      <summary>. Make Your Own Chilli Powder</summary>
      <p>
        The closest path to truth is grinding small quantities
        from whole chillies.
